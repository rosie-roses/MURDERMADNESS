# MURDERMADNESS

Murder Madness is game that is almost like cluedo that I did for a Software Engineering group project. We first started off with the text based version of the game 
and then we eventually modified it to a visual based version with GUI and using MVC. 

I worked on this group project with the following people:
1) https://github.com/Sidamjit
2) https://github.com/abi6ail
